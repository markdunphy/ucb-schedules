####Upright Citizens Brigade Calendar

This code will scrape the various UCB theatre schedules every so often and update corresponding Google Calendars. It uses node for web scraping and PHP to talk to the Google Calendar API. Note than you cannot run this code on your machine unless you swap in your own service account, calendars, and private keys.

####Contributing
Feel free to fork and open a pull request. I wouldn't recommend it since the code is garbage and nobody wants to navigate a veritable minefield of shit, but hey, go for it.
